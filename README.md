Simple user signup experiment. [http://davessignup.meteor.com/](http://davessignup.meteor.com/) 

Note! The Meteor 'autopublish' package is installed/enabled. So their is currently full read/write access to the servers database

What it does: Create a user > login > show user profile > make simple edit to user profile > retrive latest user profile info

Help Me Out!
============
Contribute to this experiment so we can learn together :) 
The goal is to learn how to work with users in Meteor when this experiment is complete and then use this as a reference for other larger projects

To Be Implemented
-----------------
* Evalutate/check password, email, username to make sure it is of a required format
* Email verification with meteor 
* Forgot password, change password capabilities 
* Login with FaceBook option
* See friends that are logged in
* Create posts when you are logged in and show who created them 
* Add picture to profile (use the same method as in a past experiment)

I think this 'to do list' is enough for now :)

Technologies
------------

Meteor.js, Jasny Bootstrap, jQuery, mongoDB
